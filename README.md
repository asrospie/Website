# Personal Website

This is the repo for my personal website located at <https://alec.surge.sh>. It is used as a resume of sorts as well as to host some quick projects for my friends and I to use. 
*Currently Under Construction*

## Hosting

This site is hosted using [Surge]<https://surge.sh>. It is currently a static website.

## Build

This website was originally built using [SvelteJS]<https://svelte.dev/>, however, I have recently updated it to [Sapper]<https://sapper.svelte.dev>. Additionally, it is utilizing TypeScript for the most part.

## To Do
- [ ] Create projects page to showcase current projects on GitHub (integrate GitHub api?)
- [ ] Populate projects page with current projects
- [ ] Migrate the experience page to an about page, replaced with overview
- [ ] Create simple blog
- [ ] Migrate to a host that supports SSR
