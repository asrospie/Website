# Personal Website

This is the repository for my personal website located at https://alec.surge.sh. The website itself is built using SvelteJS and Bootstrap. It displays my past work experience, projects, as well as proof of concepts that I'm testing such as at https://alec.surge.sh/#/dndtools.

## Future plans
- Projects page to display past and current projects
- Host downloads to finished projects
- Potentially add a blog
